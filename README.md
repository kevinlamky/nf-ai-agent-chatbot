# Objective

Your goal is to develop a Q&A chatbot in Python that responds to queries about planning applications in London, utilizing a provided dataset (Planning Application Details.csv) and 5 accompanying PDF documents. If the dataset does not contain sufficient information to answer a question, the chatbot should conduct online research by integrating a real search engine API of your choosing.

You are free to leverage any large language model (LLM), open-source resources, and relevant technologies to accomplish this task. Ideally, host the chatbot on a website for testing purposes. If hosting is not feasible, ensure the chatbot is designed in a way that allows us to easily access and evaluate its Q&A functionality.

# Sample Q&A Questions

- What is the current status of the planning application on New Brent Street?
- What details are available about the planning application on New Brent Street?
- What amenities are included at 99 City Road?
- What is the total proposed Gross Internal Area (GIA) for 99 Bishopsgate?
- How does the proposed GIA of 99 Bishopsgate compare to that of 70 Gracechurch Street?
- How many planning applications have been approved in the London Borough of Barnet?

# Deliverables

- A functional chatbot for testing
- The complete source code
- A basic diagram illustrating the AI agentâ€™s architecture (i.e., how the chatbot is structured and operates)

# Assessment Criteria

- The capability of the chatbot to provide accurate results based on the dataset and online research
- The clarity and effectiveness of the AI agent architecture design as demonstrated in the diagram and implementation
